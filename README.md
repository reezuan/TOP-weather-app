# The Weather Cat
A simple weather app, built by yours truly.

Feed it a city or country, and it'll display key weather info for that location â€“ current temperature, chance of rain, expected weather over the next 7 days, and so on.

Uses data from the Weather API at [WeatherAPI.com](https://www.weatherapi.com/).

### Notes
- The API key is exposed because I'm using the free version of the API. And I'm not at the phase of my learning journey where I've learnt how to protect API keys. I'll be sure to hide them once I know how!
